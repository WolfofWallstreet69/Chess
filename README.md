# Chess

Recreation of Chess in MATLAB with both single-player gameplay against an AI and two-player classic Chess. The three algorithms my team designed were easy, offensive, and defensive. Easy randomly selects a valid move. Offensive selects a valid move that will result in gaining the most points. Defensive selects a valid move that will result in losing the least amount of points. The defensive algorithm is required to look two moves ahead in order to determine its move, making it the most computationally complex but also the most successful algorithm. In addition to player v. player and player v. algorithm gameplay, this program also allows for algorithm v. algorithm gameplay. An algorithm v. algorithm game can be simulated move-by-move on the chess board, or a user-specified number of games can be simulated with the resulting statistics displayed to the screen.
